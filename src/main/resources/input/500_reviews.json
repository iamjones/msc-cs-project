Our cable system is such that some stations are much louder than others.  With a quick adjustment on the Samsung, that no longer is a problem.Amazon's shipping is so fast and free shipping is sure a plus.  We actually paid less for this television than we did for our Sony and this is a better television.I would absolutely recommend this television to any looking for a high quality flat screen.

(Or turn it up for partying!)I was a little disappointed in the speaker wire that came with the package.  I got about 100 feet of wire, which was barely enough to run my rear surround speakers to the back of the room. The wire is very thin--probably around 20-22 guage.  Too thin to use my wire strippers, so I had to resort to the old razor blade around once and pull with teeth technique.  In fact, the speaker wire is too thin for the connections on some of the speakers, slipping out loosely instead of being held down by the clamp action of the connector.  I doubled up the wire so that it was thick enough to hold.  I also put an order in for decent speaker wire.By the way, there is no way to hook this up directly to a computer or television.  You need an amplifier/receiver as only the sub-woofer is amplified.Given the price, I am still happy with the purchase.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Nice but comes with very thin speaker wire", "unixReviewTime": 1292630400, "reviewTime": "12 18, 2010"}

These headphones are designed to take a beating, yet still provide better than average audio fidelity.The Bend headphones are very light, made out of a plastic that is extremely flexible. You can stretch these until they are practically flat. Reinforced cables and a safe release feature for the cans provide more protection. Finally, Philips built in a feature that helps protect the headphone cable, which is cloth-covered. The cable connects to the headphone via a 3.5mm stereo headphone jack, so if it gets caught on something, the cable will break-away, and not damage the headphones. Philips has promised to replace the cable if you lose it. Additionally, the cloth-covered cable will not tangle.Now, about the sound. The 30mm drivers provide balanced sound. Bass is not deep and thumping, although these are advertised as headphones that provide powerful bass. I have used them for about 20 hours, so they may not be fully burned in yet, and bass may improve with usage. Both the mid-range and treble are clear and sharp. Nothing really overwhelms or distorts. The ear padding is very thick and pillow-like (and comfortable) and I have not experienced any discomfort with the plastic headband. These headphones sit on top of your ears, not over them, so sound isolation is average at best, which means you will hear the roar of the train or plane. And, if you are using these in a quiet room, there may be some sound leakage.I would recommend these headphones, especially if you are looking for decent sounding headphones that you can throw into a backpack or an overnight bag.

This new R1i improves on the sound of the old RS1 with more detail and better bass performance. I bought these after sort of lusting after them for MANY years. Probably 15 years or so or whenever these were released. I already owned the newer PS-500, which are 5 star phones without question. The R1si arrived and my 1st thought was \"wow, the packing box is nicer than the PS-500\" - then when I opened the box the beauty of the headphones struck me instantly. They are absolutely gorgeous. AND they are incredibly light. MUCH lighter feeling in my hands and head than the PS500. I was thinking...man, even if these sound awful I will keep them for the looks as they look great with my RA1 amp.Yes, I own the RA1 amp paired with a DAC feeding high res files from my mac. The amp is a perfect mate for my PS500 so I assumed it would be even better with the R1si.My 1st listening test ... I was hugely disapointed. Gone was the rich, liquid, sensual and full sound of my PS500. It was replaced with a sharp, dry, and hard to take midrange that was excessively forward. I let then burn in for a while..and each time I came back to them they sounded a teeny bit better but even still, they were no match sonically for the $100 less expensive PS-500. They look better, they feel better and  they come with the extra cables and better box but for sound, the PS500 rule the roost.PS500 at $595 is a steal of a deal. They provide a rich, detailed but warm, thick and sexy sound while giving a nice wide soundstage (though not as wide as the PS1000 or HD800). The R1si's seem a bit closed in, lack the soundstage and are a bit sharp. Female vocals turned up loud will pierce through your brain. Rock is too bright. If i did not have the PS500s to compare i would not know any better and I would probably get used to the R1si sound and be happy but side by side it was no contest.I appreciate the RS1i's for the look design and style (which I love) but you can do better for less.

I mean, some of the reviews are absolutely glowing.Here's my take. Right off the bat, I thought the sound was a little muddy ... or muffled ... both. I really expected more clarity than this speaker puts out. When adjusted to a level that I prefer to listen to, the high notes just aren't clear. However, things get better when you increase the volume, and I must say that for such a small speaker it really can fill a room with sound.At first, I thought my initial disappointment was due to the fact that I own a home theater system with sound that can put most movie theaters to shame. But realizing that that was a very unfair comparison, I decided to compare the Supersonic bluetooth speaker with another small speaker I own: the Altec Lansing Music Speaker --Altec Lansing iM 207 SpeakerThis confirmed my suspicions. The Altec Lansing produced crisp highs and midtones, but very little bass. Still, it still sounds better to me for all-around listening. The disadvantage is that this speaker is not wireless; you have to plug it in to your sound source. Also, the Altec requires 3 AAA batteries, and is not rechargeable by itself (but you can use rechargeable batteries).The cool factor for the Supersonic is that it is wireless. The bluetooth connected very quickly, and it picks up the signal from my iPod from halfway across the house.By the way, I plugged my Altec speaker into the output port of my Supersonic speaker, and with both of them playing together, the sound was much improved. The only strange thing is that when I did this, the volume on both speaker units dropped very low. I don't understand this, since they both have their own power supply.As far as build quality, the Supersonic appears very well put together. No complaints here. The speaker does not come with a charging block, only the cable. But it appears you can use any USB charging unit -- such as the one that came with my iPod.Overall, I think the speaker is a cool gadget, and I hope to get lots of use out of it. But don't expect it blow you away with high fidelity sound.

As other reviewers have pointed out, the supposedly dust-free, lint-free swab often ends up leaving residual fibers on the sensor and in the chamber, compounding the issues around cleaning it effectively.I often must use 2-4 swabs to clean the sensor, and sometimes there is still a small dust spec that I'm afraid to go after with yet another swab, for fear of depositing more stuff on the sensor.  There has got to be a better substance for the swab that won't leave residual fibers.

I've been cleaning my digital sensors for years, dating back to my former cropped sensor cameras.  I use a sensor scope for the procedure so that I can effectively see whether the sensor is clean.  I found the smaller sensors much easier to clean with the smaller swabs.Realistically, be prepared to be frustrated with the cleaning procedure.

But compared to my 3-year-old Garmin Nuvi 200 (the cheapest modern GPS you can buy), it comes up short.  The only reason I wanted a new GPS was to get one that could read street names out loud.  This Moto has way more features than I needed but I saw a good lightning deal price so I decided to give it a try.  I'm sending it back and ordering another Garmin!The display is better on the Garmin: the colors have better contrast, and the road names are easier to read.  The voice is also clearer on the Garmin and louder (perhaps a smaller speaker on the Moto?).  This is a concern for me since I drive a diesel truck and I need something LOUD.Also, one of the best features of Garmin is their super-simple user interface.  On the Garmin, if I want to find banks near me, it's as simple as clicking a big button that says \"Banks/ATMs\".  On the Moto, I have to type the name of the bank I'm looking for or, (I finally discovered) I can type the word \"bank\" and then open the right-side panel, click on the tab to sort by category, and click on the \"Banks\" category.  And the Moto seems to have a pre-set limit on the number of matches it will show you.  If the Bank you want is a little farther away from your current position, too bad.  The Garmin just keeps them coming as long as you keep scrolling.  The Garmin has the simplest, most elegant user interface by far.I will give the Moto credit for one amazingly cool feature: you can add as many waypoints to your route as you like, and you can *drag*and*drop* them to reorder them!  This could be a very very valuable feature for some users.  The Garmin (at least the inexpensive ones) allow one via point on the way to your final destination.In 2008 I was on a road trip and I damaged the screen on my Garmin.  I stopped at the nearest Big Box and purchased a Magellan.  I ended up selling the Magellan on eBay when I got home because I couldn't stand the interface.

Kerrigan", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I spend most of my day at a computer writing code and typing emails (or similar) so I wanted to try a premium mechanical keyboard like this one.Now that I'm used to it, I really like it. The Cherry MX Blue switches feel good--crisp, tactile, high-quality. At times, I do feel like I can type faster and with less effort/thought with this keyboard than with a regular rubber dome keyboard. Regular keyboards now feel too mushy to me and I avoid them. I also appreciate how this particular keyboard has a nice premium soft-touch coating, and it doesn't take up any more space than it needs to--there's very little overhang past the keys in any direction. I got the model with very little branding--just some on the front (facing the monitor) which I can't see when I'm using it. The font used on the keys is a little \"gamer-y\" (it looks like the Battlestar Galactica logo) but I rarely look at the keyboard while I'm typing so it doesn't bother me at all. The paint on the keys is pretty thick and I can feel it while I'm typing, but it doesn't bother me. I expect it to wear off after a while, which is something that other reviewers have complained about. I can see how this could be considered a poor design decision and not acceptable for such an expensive keyboard, but I'm only concerned with how well the keyboard works (not looks) so I'm not going to deduct any stars.As I alluded to earlier, the keyboard did take some getting used to, at least if you're coming from a rubber dome keyboard. The keyboard is taller than almost any rubber dome keyboard, and the keys are taller and have more travel, and there is no built-in wrist rest. So if you rest your wrists on your desk (I know you're not supposed to, but I do), you will have to bend them at a sharper angle, which might cause some wrist pain. Also, many keyboards these days have smooth edges on the keys at the bottom, e.g., the edge where your thumb rests on the spacebar. This keyboard does not, so the side of your thumb might get sore. I also wasn't used to keys with so much travel and initially my fingers were getting \"stuck\" between the keys and that caused a lot of typos. But I will say that after ~2 weeks of using the keyboard, I have adapted to it and I have no unusual wrist pain or thumb soreness, and I can type as accurately with it as any other keyboard I've used.There are a couple more possible negatives to mention, which may or may not be important to you. One is the amount of noise the keyboard makes. You quickly get used to it, but the people around you might not. I think it's likely not appropriate for an open office environment. (One more thing about the noise: sometimes it makes a slight \"ringing\" noise after you're done typing something... one more thing to get used to.) The keyboard is also relatively heavy. I didn't realize how often I repositioned my keyboard during the day until I got this keyboard, which is pretty inconvenient to reposition.Ultimately, if you're in the market for a mechanical keyboard, I think this particular one is a great buy. It's less expensive ($30+) than most of its direct competition and it doesn't have any downsides that the other keyboards wouldn't also have. It also doesn't have some of the deal-breaking design flaws that some of them do have, like flimsy USB connectors that are prone to breaking, or a different switch type for the space bar that feels weird, etc. Overall I think it's a great purchase and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good keyboard, takes a little getting used to", "unixReviewTime": 1379030400, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2013"}

I hate the wireless adapters that attempt to replace the Windows 7 interface for managing wireless networks with a custom one. This does not attempt that. It's only so much bloat-ware, so you're better off without it.There was a moment during installation that I realized that it was dropping software directories in the 32-bit installation directory of my 64-bit OS, but before I had time to get annoyed about it, the installation program completed unpacking all it's files, checked to see what version of the OS I was using and deleted all the other driver directories leaving only the Win7 64-bit driver installation package behind. The installation software prompts you to install the USB device when it's ready, and shortly afterwards there is a system reboot.- Hardware Installation  -My main complaint about this device is the form-factor. The wireless adapter is a direct plug USB device which unfortunately will block access to any adjacent USB ports.The ports on my laptop where I tried this are on both sides of the machine, one set horizontal, the other vertical. The Belkin USB wireless device blocked an adjacent port no matter which side I tried it on.Also, be aware that it does stick out a good 2 inches or so - mobile users will have to take care that the device is not knocked or leaned on while in the port as that will cause damage to the USB adapter, the port or the motherboard of your laptop. This was destined for a stationary tower PC, so was not a concern for me, but notebook users should be aware.- Performance -The wireless adapter got an excellent signal through a concrete cinderblock wall that separates me from the wireless router I use. I was on a G signal, not an N, and got excellent signal strength and a steady 54mbps.  My normal wireless adapter is a Dell DW150 half-mini card installed inside my laptop. This test was promising enough that I was willing to install the Belkin on my entertainment center PC which currently has an old Linksys wireless card with a massive antenna.Final Installation - Or Where it All Fell Apart.The problem with the size of the Belkin N150 became apparent when installing it on a rear panel USB port of my entertainment center PC. It blocks other nearby ports which are currently in use. On my tower PC motherboard (As with most motherboards) the on-board USB ports are all close together. In this case, the Belkin adapter would either not fit, or block two adjacent USB ports, or one and a firewire port. I also have a rear extension panel, where I tried the device next, except that it blocked the second port of that as well.I did pull out devices from the adjacent port to try it, and also try the Belkin on a couple front panel ports. While I could get the hardware recognized by WIndows, I could not get a wireless signal on the tower. Both the laptop and tower are in the same room.- Conclusion -I must conclude that there is something about my entertainment PC hardware or software that does not like this device. Though the intended use on my  tower PC was impossible, on my laptop, the installation and performance on a 802.11g network were flawless and aside from the size of the device, make for a good recommendation.

Of note, I owned a TOMTOM before.I am not sure why this unit keeps getting rave reviews, but I am sure that those rating it are going by the available features and not actually USING the unit.1.  It will NOT recognize left turns.  Let's say your destination is a shopping area on the right.  There are plenty of stop lights to turn left to get you to your destination.  But for some reason, the unit will have you turn right into a completely different shopping area, then cross a busy intersection to get to your destination.  At first I thought it because I had \"AVOID U TURNS\" selected (even though it wasn't a U turn) but even after disabling that feature, it continued to do it.  And at 3 different destinations!! I don't know if that is true for every destination (since I only had it for a week and some destinations were on the right) but it did it for EVERY LEFT TURN... even after I upgraded the maps.2.  I wasn't happy with the lack of customizable features for the map or even the settings in general.  Perhaps the worst was the fact that on the map it showed estimated ARRIVAL TIME (which was always wrong but would correct it self as the minutes would pass).  There is no way to get useful information on the screen like miles remaining in trip.3.  The traffic was useless.  It never detected serious traffic until you were sitting bumper-to-bumper in it and it would frequently say there was traffic when there was none. No wonder its free.Those are deal breakers for me.The things I did like1.  TTS (but that's not unique to Garmin)2.  Automatic power on and off if connected to car via cord (I think that is unique to Garmin)3.  Auto option for day and night maps (again, I think that is unique to Garmin).4.  They (Garmin and TomTom) both allow for map updates, but Garmin is cheaper (lifetime is $120 - which is 4 maps per year vs. TomTom's $80 per year).Never used the bluetooth, so I can't comment.  I have a centro which can't do voice dialing via BT anyway so it was no biggie for me.Overall, I hated the unit.

Frary \"Gochugogi\"", "helpful": [23, 24], "reviewText": "A needed a compact monopod for travel so I clicked on the Sirui P-326. A handsome monopod with impeccable workmanship landed in my mailbox: quality materials, ultra clean fit and finish and silky smooth moving parts. The low rez product images on Amazon don't do it justice. It's a mere 15 inches retracted, easily fitting in a bike messenger or camera bag. And, at barely 1/2 pound, weighs about the same as a compact umbrella.  A few seconds of twisting and it's fully extended. One reviewer is able to twist all 6 leg locks at once. However, my average sized mitts can only twist 3 or 4 of them at once. I'm 5'8' and, when fully extended, the P-326 is too tall for me with DSLR attached, so I leave the smallest section retracted.MOUNTING CAMERAS: I love the reversible 1/4 to 3/8 mounting stud and disk with built-in nut wrench, making for fast switching between a head or direct mounting on the disk. The design is simple but shows the care and thought that went into engineering. I don't have gear anywhere near the 22LB rating of this 'pod, but it has no problem supporting my EOS 6D and EF 300 4L USM.  This is a solid stick: no flex, slipping or play in the leg sections. The leg locks are strong enough for this 'pod to serve as a walking stick and don't flinch when I lean my mighty 140 LB frame into them. I'm hoping I can sneak this guy into places not allowing tripods, and using it as a cane sounds like a plan! Although the P-326 is wee when retracted, the leg sections are far less slip prone than my big bruiser \"nightstick\" Manfrotto 679B, a longer and heavier monopod.I use a small quick release clamp so I don't have to waste time screwing and unscrewing my camera. TheSUNWAYFOTO Discal Clamp DDY-58 DDY58 ARCA Compatibleis a perfect match for the P-326, being the same color and diameter as the monopod disk (58mm). It fits perfect and appears integral to the design. I wouldn't mind a ball head for museum and church interiors but the idea with a travel stick is to keep it small and light, hence only an Arca clamp.CARRYING THE P-326: The Sirui comes with a light duty hand-strap, a wee compass (!) and an aluminum keychain grade carabiner for attaching to a belt loop or bag. The strap threads into an aluminum retainer beneath the disk and is easy to change, remove or upgrade. If you use the carabiner I recommend upgrading to a stainless steel locking carabiner so you don't lose the P-326 on a mountain trail or noisy sidewalk. For city trekking I use aMAGLITE ASXD036 Plain Leather Belt Holder for D-Cell Flashlight, Blackflashlight holster: loose enough to quickly draw or holster, more stable on my leg than a carabiner and holds securely as long as I don't do flips or handstands. At $5 it's a bargain, especially compared to the bulkyGitzo GC5330 Series 1-5 Monopod Holsterselling for $40. My wife informed me a monopod on my belt looks nerdy but sure is handy.The P-326 is the best stick I've ever owned and highly recommended!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Light, compact, stable & really well made!", "unixReviewTime": 1364601600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2013"}

The Tomtom GPS receiver is pretty, but the necessity of switching it on each time you use it (rather than it coming on with external power) has made it a pain to own and I'm going to toss it in a drawer or donate it to a GPSless friend.I use a Dell Axim X51v, so performance is not an issue, even on thousand mile routes the initial route calculation only takes a few seconds.Installation. The installation was simple and trouble free. I had heard that getting the product registered might be an issue but as soon as I connected my PDA to the internet and entered the key I got authorized. I guess the individual state maps are on the rest of the CDs, I only needed the installation and the first two map CDs. For myself I'd rather this had been on a DVD. By comparison iGuidance Europe, which is on a DVD, took two trips to the Internet to search for help and quite a bit of messing with the Bluetooth connection before it could see the receiver.Connecting. If the application is started whilst Bluetooth is disabled on the PDA it simply enables it and connects. Other than waiting a few seconds there has never been an issue with the Bluetooth initerface. If you need to pair it the code is 0000. If you need to use a different GPS then tap the screen, hit \"change preferences\" then three right arrows and then \"show GPS status\". Hit the \"Configure\", use the arrows to select the right hardware and hit Select. Easy. In iGuidance I had to add the receiver as an 'outgoing' serial connection and then tell it which com port had been assigned.The hardware works reasonably well, the Bluetooth receiver has mostly locked on fast and stayed locked everywhere except inside tunnels and a ferry, and even there it managed to receive a couple of satellites (how?). Twice the lock on has taken more than ten minutes, I have no clue why, the satellite display showed around eight good signals but it just didn't lock on. A selling point of the hardware is that it shuts off if the Bluetooth link is down for more than a few minutes. That is sensible, no point running the battery down. But there's a down side, if you want to put the receiver somewhere where it can get a good signal, like on the rear parcel shelf and plugged into a power socket in the trunk, then you'd rather not have to climb in the back each time you get in the car to switch on the receiver. In the long run this may be a killer for me, units like the Holux GPSlim236 can be plugged in and forgotten, they can also take an external antenna which the Tomtom can't... though to be fair it shows no sign of needing it either, in the middle of the first floor of a 300' wide multi floor parking structure it still locked onto six satellites.The 3D and normal map displays are both useful, however the zoom controls only last a few seconds and then the map returns to showing only a small section of road ahead. The zoom seems to be controlled partially by proximity to your next turn and partly by local road details, so in urban areas you get about a quarter of a mile. Perhaps they did this for safety, but in that case they shouldn't have provided the controls. In cities this is ok but when you are driving around rural areas it doesn't let you see the area around you, so you can't see if your route is sensible. I have taken to using the browse map view and then moving it as I drive in rural areas. I should be able to zoom the display until it shows a level of detail that is useful to me and it should stay there. When zoomed out the map display does continue to show useful detail, iGuidance drops too many map features and if you are on small remote roads can leave you looking at a blank screen.There are many choices for map colors and it's easy to get day and night color schemes that give good contrast and visibility. You can also choose from several clear male and female voice options, in English these include US, English and Australian accents. Terminology tracks accent, so if you choose English English you get motorways instead of freeways; amusing but not a problem.The text at the bottom of the screen can show the next turn, speed, distance to go, current time, time to go and eta. The choices are configurable, but nothing like the twenty or thirty that Garmin allowed you to choose from six years ago. The text is very small, I have good eyes and I really have to look hard to see the figures. If I'm 400 miles from my next turn I need to know that a lot more than I need to know I'm going to be turning left when I get there. For this sort of price it should be possible to have more control of the information displayed. iGuidance shows even less information and gives you less control. But this is another case where Garmin had a better solution six years ago.Touching the lower right corner brings up the overview of the route, this should have pan/zoom controls and be in the day/night color scheme. For a trip of several hundred miles it's hardly possile to make out the route on the full VGA display of the X51v.The options for finding a destination are easy to use, the ones I have needed were address, city center, POI and point on map. The routing is also non-volatile, so you can stop for the night and resume in the morning.  One strange thing is that the previous destinations are stored per map, so if you route to a city on the major roads map and then switch to a more detailed map the destination isn't on the list of recent destinations. The unit exhibits a common problem to north american products, you can't route between countries, you can't ask for a route from Calgary Alberta to Salt Lake City Utah because there isn't a map that has both cities. If you want to route from Bute Montana to Idaho Falls Idaho you have to use the major roads map because the states are on different major maps, west and plains. Worth bearing in mind if you live on a border.Trip time predictions are very poor. For a trip from Alameda CA to Port Angeles WA the initial prediction was around 18 hours, which means they are using an average speed of around 50mph. That may be reasonable for I880 on a Monday at 9am but it's 50% out for I5 in northern california. The actual duration was about 14 hours including stops for food and fuel and a visit to Hertz in Portland, OR. On smaller roads the errors are much larger. For the Nephi UT to Tonopah, NV the predicted time was over eight hours and the actual trip time was just over four. On major rural roads in Canada with a 60mph limit the trip times appear to be based on a 30mph average.Routing is fast and the suggested route is certainly in the right direction, but there are issues related to poor choices of road speeds. The software works out the time taken for various routes based on the average speeds for those road classes, but the low freway and major road settings lead it to choose apparently shorter routes through urban areas, this means that it avoids fast roads like US101. In Calgary it routed my south for miles on city streets when I was only half a mile from Deerfoot Trail which is a 65mph road with no stop lights and ultimately becomes I15 at the border. There are also minor weirdnesses, on my daily commute I take I880 south from Oakland CA to San Jose CA, at I238 it directs me to take the off ramp, then then on ramp back to I880. Strangely, if you start from a different place it is able to route you straight down I880 without detouring to the off ramp. Mostly the routes aren't bad though, but Garmin did it better five years ago.Rerouting: If you ask for an alternate route it seeks an alternate for all of the route. So if you are going from Oakland, CA to Seattle, WA and get stuck in traffic trying to get to the freeway and ask for another route it will not only change the entrance onto the freeway, it will also reroute the rest of the trip, so instead of a long day on I5 you may find yourself on a three day drive up the coast. The simple solution is to divert until you are past the problem and then to resubmit the original destination.There are some major mapping errors, much of the time in Canada and Montana the mapped road position was tens or even hundreds of yards from the actual position. This causes the software to either show you driving through open fields near the road, or down the wrong side of a freeway, or even down the frontage road hundreds of yards away on the far side of the freeway in Banff national park. This causes some strange voice directions too, like \"turn around when possible\" when you are driving down I15 at 70mph and have been going the right way for hours and have to keep going straight ahead for hours. Most city streets in the US are spot on though. But the maps do seem to be 2-4 years out of date.POI problems. The POI list is very lacking. Maybe half to two thirds of gas stations are missing. But worse is the method of selecting POIs. You can look up stores by name, but in the case of the major chains you can get quite a few hits. In places like the San Francisco Bay Area there's a world of difference between somewhere 11 miles down I880 and ten miles across the bay, the first is a 22 mile round trip and the second could be 70. All you get is a list of stores with distances, no address, no direction. So you can't tell which 15 mile distant place they are in. If you select the wrong one and thereby discover that you need to drive thirty miles and cross a toll bridge to get there then there's no back button, you have to go through the whole POI selection process again. This is a method that is not yet ready for the real world. It took me a good ten minutes to discover that the POI list didn't know about the particular version of the store that I thought it should know, I guess I didn't really need it, but then I'm not always in my own back yard. Garmin gives the address and direction of POIs before you commit to one.The map accuracy and POI list needs a lot of work.Only the main map display follows the day/night color scheme, the route map and browsable maps remain in their standard eye wateringly bright colors. A brightness control would be more useful than night colors, but to get to that you have to go to the PDA settings, not something I feel like doing whilst driving.At the end of November '05 Tomtom released Navigator version 5.21 for Windows Mobile 5. The behavior of the system has certainly changed. The most noticeable thing is that it now strongly prefers the shortest route in many situations. Unfortunately that means that it will now route me on surface streets rather than the adjacent interstate. For example Alameda to Emeryville can be achieved almost exclusively at 60mph+ on I880, I980, I580 and I80 and yet the new version chooses the surface streets at 25mph with lights every block. I suppose it can't be expected to know that the route it chooses goes through West Oakland which has more murders than most European countries. In the Mojave and Death Valley it often routed me down dirt roads when there was a decent highway nearby. Whether it's the map data or the routing, they need to know that a trail formed by a bulldozer driving through the desert isn't the same thing as a metaled road.I have contacted Tomtom customer support about the ludicrous average speeds, however they have not contacted me in a month, much less the 24 hours they promissed. Neither Tomtom not Teleatlas have given any sort of response to my eight map error reports, if I am going to all that trouble to accurately describe their errors the least they can do is acknowledge that they have received them, right now I don't know if they are dropping them in the round filling cabinet.After more research I have found many reports of Tele-Atlas inaccuracies (in the UK, for example, major towns missing and impossible directions at some of the bussiest interchanges in the country, like the M4-M25 near Heathrow airport, which may well be the first interchange many foreigners meet in the UK) and even major cities missing from the database.Compared to iNavigator 2.1.2 Europe: Tomtom update rates are faster, the maps are drawn better, the voice prompts are timed and spaced better. Tomtom shows more useful data than iNavigator, though still not near the standard of old Garmin dedicated units.  iNavigator Europe has some serious usability issues related to windows-style menus covering up essential controls like the map zoom and exit buttons. The zoom control on iNavigator is persistant, but not available as often and is very difficult to use whilst driving (on Tomtom the top corners zoom out and in, on iNavigator it's a tiny little control at the bottom center).  It may not be fair to compare the US Tomtom (Teleatlas) maps to the European iNavigator (Navtech) maps, but they are about comparable. Both have their issues but will still get you there in the end.On balance still a good product, however I am becoming concerned that the hype of the advertising campaigns isn't matched by world class technical teams. It took more than a month to answer the first support question with \"sorry, no\". But to be fair, most of it works well. And it is very pretty. Overall I haven't seen a better solution.Around two months after I asked some fairly pointed questions, on their web site, I just received three emails saying that I must update my questions to indicate that I still required support or they would close them if I did not respond in 48 hours. So I did. In each case I commented \"yes I still want you to answer my question\". That's an interesting technique for clearing your tech support backlog, but it does nothing for your customers. I'm starting to think that all they want is your money and they don't care whether they, or their product, does a good job.Despite my response they closed the calls 48 hours later. Not good.I did finally get some answers from support. You can buy the European maps on-line for a very reasonable price. They don't have any solution for the GPS receiver powering off when it loses bluetooth comms and they don't see it as an issue.I'm looking forward to a software upgrade which I hear should come out soon. I'll update this review when it does.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good product let down by maps, routing and support", "unixReviewTime": 1132790400, "reviewTime": "11 24, 2005"}

I wanted what I hoped would be the best cover with the added nice option of having a keyboard...a lighted one at that!First off, the cover while being protective isn't particularly &#34;grip-py&#34; enough in it's tactile feel, it fact it can be slick.  Second, when she's using her iPad in bed prior to turning in for the evening it is next to impossible to get keep it from sliding out of the &#34;propped-up&#34; position.  This is a huge FATAL FLAW!  Any cover should have either a secure propped-up solution or a locking one.  This one has the worst I've ever seen as it barely will prop up and certainly will not remain so.Next, my wife has to press a button to &#34;MATE&#34; the BT keyboard with the iPad Air.  She'd rather just use the screen's keyboard she says because she forgets to join the keys and the screen.  Could be more my wife's forgetfulness, but whatever the reason the keyboard isn't a hit like I'd hoped it would be either.On the plus side, the materials used are quality even if the cover isn't the rubber-like tactile feel I, and apparently a lot of others, prefer.  The keyboard is beautiful all lit up and is somewhat amazing as it is possible to change the backlight color which while being non-critical is a very nice touch.  The keyboard itself is like a little brick - meaning it is built somewhat like a tank.  It has a bit of weight to it giving it an impression of being very solid indeed.  It is magnetic and will stay put until you forcibly detach it from the cover.  The battery life is excellent.  I do not even know exactly how long with light use it can go, but suffice to say I don't think we'll have any issues with the battery not lasting long-enough since my wife for whatever reason just prefers the on-screen keys.I would not buy this if I knew what I know after purchasing.  While maybe great for some users it has not been so for my wife and I wholeheartedly agree since it will not stay properly propped-up for love or money.  I actually hate the fact the back prop isn't worth a dime because this is a &#34;deal killer&#34; for us.  I'm going to buy my wife another cover simply put.  I feel dumb trying to &#34;over-achieve&#34; and get the best and what I thought was most advanced cover, out there.  This really backfired as a complete waste of money.  My daughter, who lives in Nashville, bought a simple pink rubber cover for her iPad Air at the Apple store.  She gave too much in a way for such a simple cover at $30...But, she didn't waste a dime because her cover does what it should.  It protects first and foremost, it will prop-up either on her lap while sitting down or laying in bed and it stays propped-up until you decide to un-prop it.  And, finally, it has the perfect tactile slightly sticky (doesn't act like dust mag though) feel whereby you won't accidently lose your grip and drop your iPad unless you're just have a bad moment.  These are the things a cover should do and the Kennsington Key Folio is a glorious costly failure as far as I'm concerned.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Not An Elegant Solution Overall", "unixReviewTime": 1390262400, "reviewTime": "01 21, 2014"}

It is written such that the author clearly is not a native English speaker. In spite of this, it is very simple and straightforward. We are not talking rocket science here.Once this is plugged into an electrical outlet, and in range of your computer, you should be able to get to the homepage of the unit, by typing into your browser address bar the TP-Links address, which is: 192.168.0.254.Also, you should be able to ping this address and get a response. It's quite simple. The fact that I could neither ping this or get to the homepage, inspite of Windows Connection Troubleshooter seeing it, and giving a message that it wasn't responding, tells me this unit is defective.I plugged it in and the little blue light lit up to tell me it was indeed plugged in, but my computer was unable to use it.I pinged the device several times, and this was never pingable.Of course, I couldn't get to the tp-links homepage either, which is 192.168.0.254. This should be simple and straitforward. My Windows connection troubleshooter could see the device since it identified it, but it gave the message :TR-WR702N not responding.I conclude that the one I got is defective.I notice in some other one star reviews that people are making this simple device into something much more complicated than it is. If you plug this into an electrical outlet, and then type into your browsers address bar: 192.168.0.254, you should see the login to the homepage of this device. If you get that far and see the login page, your device is working, and you have an operating unit.If you simply want a repeater, in other words, to extend the range of your wireless router, simply plug this in. That's it. Check to see that it's working by trying to get to the login page of the device. That's what I intended to use this for, but it doesn't respond to requests from my computer.If you want a bridge, you would be creating a secondary local area connection. This would be used if you own, for instance, a restaurant, and want your guests to be able to use your internet connection without having access to your personal data.Here are the starting instructions, copied and pasted, from the user manual:\"Preparation*Make sure the Main Router is on the Internet and you got the necessary Information of it as above.*Since the default mode of TL-WR700N/TL-WR702N is AP, the DHCP function on them is disabled by default. We have to manually assign an IP address as 192.168.0.X to the computer to match the default IP address (192.168.0.254) of the Repeater. Please click here for detailed instruction.*Connect the computer to the TL-WR700N/TL-WR702N with an Ethernet cable.Step1 Change the Working mode to Repeater.1. Set a static IP as 192.168.0.X to your computer. If you do not know how to change it, please click here.2. Open the Internet Explorer and type the IP address of the access point (Default is 192.168.0.254) into the address bar and then Press Enter:3. Type the username and password into the boxes of the login page, the default username and password are both admin, then press Enter:\"As you can see, the wording could be better. And it's needlessly confusing. All you need to do is plug this device into an A/C outlet, and then type in the IP address of it's homepage. In other words, start from number 2. in the instructions.The DHCP server is disabled is AP (access point) mode. With a simple network you only want one DHCP server so the typical set up is one router which provides all services and multiple AP's, such as this device, to provide coverage.As far as this goes; \"We have to manually assign an IP address as 192.168.0.X\",Since I am using the same brand of router, a TP-Link, my IP address is in the 192.168.0.X configuration.  Your router brand will determine your configuration.  Belkin routers, for instance have the 192.168.2.1 configuration, and you can easily change this IPin your routers homepage.To summarize:1. I could not get to the login of the homepage of the device.2. I could not ping the device.3. Windows connection troubleshooter gave me the message: TR-WR702N not responding.I will update this if I get a replacement that works from the manufacturer.  I have contacted TP-Link and am waiting to hear back from them.Edit: Customer service has been super responsive, and I have received a replacement from them, so an update to this device will be forthcoming in the next few days.  Very impressed with customer service!UPDATE 4/20/2013Customer service has been excellent and I was shipped a replacement unit.The replacement unit does project a network that my computer can see, unlike the first unit.However I was never able to use it.  The password was not recognized.The default password for these units is \"admin\", and I got a message that it was the wrong password.  After trying this over a dozen times, and also trying the password that is printed on the bottom of the device, with the same result,  I have no idea how to log onto the network that this is broadcasting.When I get more time I will contact support and continue to try to get this to work for me.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Received apparently defective unit", "unixReviewTime": 1364774400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2013"}

This laptop delivers amazing value for the price. HP has definately brought their 'A' game on this model. There are a couple things you *need* to know before you buy this laptop.First, the model I bought advertised a 500 GB hard drive. This is true, however it is 2 x 250 GB hard drives. Not that big of a deal, but I cannot believe it is not listed as such.Second, the laptop comes preloaded with a ton of junk and is heavily integrated with Windows Live stuff. Messenger, Live toolbar, etc. It comes with a trial of Norton Internet Security and a trial of Office 2007. My advice: Get Norton off the computer ASAP and install another anti-virus product.Third, no operating system CD's come with the package. There is a \"Recovery\" partition that contains about 12 GB of stuff (not 100% sure what exactly is on there). I do know that when setting up the computer it tells you you should create recovery CD's. I went through the setup to create the discs and here's the kicker - they want 21 CD's or 3 DVD's to create the recovery discs. Talk about stupid.As of now, I have wiped the OS partition and loaded Windows 7 Beta. The driver recognition is fantastic on Windows 7 - both my wired and wireless ethernet drivers were install out-of-the-box.The look and feel of this model is gorgeous. The 17\" HD screen is amazing and the whole laptop has this slick look and feel to it. The bronze color scheme really stands out.All in all, you cannot beat the price of this laptop. For what it comes with, a comparable model from another vendor would cost $600-700 more than what I bought mine for ($898 + tax).Last, this is just my opinion and should be taken as such. Please do yourself a favor and do not install XP on this. This laptop is too great to go back to XP. AERO does look nice and this laptop should be able to run anything you throw at it. Even a clean install of Vista should not give you any problems. While XP works great for most people, do not fight change and try to give Vista/7 a fair chance.

During my 16 months of use, this product has proven itself as a very useful and durable piece of equipment, well worth the $95 I paid at the time.1- It is easy to mount on your plate and you can even mount it on top of an existing plate frame. (You don't need to have it on the bare plate as shown on picture). You may need a single drill to get the cord going into your trunk area but that does not look nasty in my car. I am not a techie so I got it installed in best buy (geek squad) to my boyo dashboard monitorBOYO VTM4301 4.3-Inch Rear View Monitorand paid $75 for that (after negotiating from the initial price of $100.) Like many users, mine is powered by a lateral cord coming from the rear transmission light so, it switches on as soon as I put my car in to reverse (approximately 2 seconds delay)2- It is a good quality camera. Over the time, this outside camera got exposed to a wide range of temperature extremes (-6F to +105 F) rain, snow, direct sunlight, and many more... No problems, what so ever. I can say that It had exceeded my expectations.3- Decent picture quality even in complete darkness. In my opinion this is not an artistic camera so expecting a professional HD or a movie quality would be unrealistic. This camera provides very clear images without distortion and is great to record details both in light and dark. You will never complain that you can not see something in dark like many others do with different cameras.4- It can move in the vertical direction and this helps adjusting the camera according to the position of your plate and the height of your car. However it is stiff enough not to move on its own unintentionally. For example, opening and shutting the trunk or car motion does not shift the angle.5-Thanks to its slim design, it does not attract lots of attention (hardly noticeable)  which makes it less likely to get stolen. I am not sure if anyone would bother stealing something that cheap but anyways.Cons:-The price as of june 2014 is $112 which is $17 more than what I bought it for. Amazon sometimes makes this type of  price fluctuations but I think it is not a fair increase and you may want to consider other vendors for better deals.-Although I am happy over all, I can still say it would be better if it had a little wider angle. But that increase would come with image distortion and might be irritating as well. My recommendation is that if you are backing up from a parking lot where two giant cars had been parked on both sides, you pay extra attention to the traffic behind while inching little by little.My conclusion is that this is a great camera that does the job pretty well.

I use a small tray, but a hard cover book or even a clip board will work if they're the right size. The picture on the box shows someone  using it on their lap without the stand up but their legs are slightly apart - I wouldn't advise anyone to go by that picture because it still might not allow for proper ventilation for your machine, but that may depend on where the air vents on your machine are located.The way the cooling base's fan is situated, if the stand is not up then the air can't circulate too well and it not only uses up more energy trying to work (thus taxing your power source), but it won't work effectively, which I'm thinking could probably lead the thing to burn out sooner or later.  So make sure the stand is propped up and that the base is on a hard, flat surface.Next, the base's stand itself is a wee bit flimsy in that it easily falls down. I would suggest that the designer of this cooling base design some way that the stand can lock into place so that it doesn't keep collapsing - the slightest move can cause the durned thing to close up so if you're using it on your lap that can be a problem.  (Additionally, the designers of this product would do well to design one with a front stand as well - that also locks into place when it's open.)The second thing I don't like is that when I lift the stand up, it angles the laptop down a little too far for my own personal comfort level - so I compensate for that by propping the front end of the base up with one of my kids' wooden building blocks.  Since I place the unit on a small plastic tray that has edges on it, this works great.  The little tray I use is about 9 inches by 12 inches - and the little block I use gets propped against the sidewall of the tray so it doesn't slide out from underneath the laptop.One thing that's really cool (literally!) is how well the fan on this thing works, and it's so quiet you really can't hear it going unless you have the hearing capabilities of a dog, so there's really no noise interference to worry about.  But I've noticed that the tray I set my cooling stand on feels like it has been in the refrigerator after less than a minute of use - which I'm sure my laptop loves - but it can get cold on the legs.  Probably feels good in the summer time, though.  Anyway I put a small blanket or towel between me and the tray that I set this on when it's on my lap because even through my pants it begins to feel cold.This is a very efficient cooling base when used correctly - I highly recommend it, despite the issue with the stand.  You just can't beat this for the price, and if there is a re-design that fixes the stand issue for roughly the same price I paid for this one, I'll definitely purchase it.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice little contraption.  :-)", "unixReviewTime": 1330300800, "reviewTime": "02 27, 2012"}

I currently have a smart cover on my iPad along with a Belkin snap shield case. The smart cover places the iPad at too steep of an incline for note taking, so I was looking for a stand that would fold flat easily and allow enough room for my iPad to fit without removing either or both of the covers. This stand certainly does the job! It is a simple wire stand coated in a black smooth rubber like plastic. It has three adjustable parts to allow for a near infinite range of angles, with screw/knobs on either end to tighten the stand into a specific angle. The rubberized material coating the wires keeps the stand quite stable and prevents it from sliding across the surface it rests upon. Some previous reviewers noted that the bottom support bar blocks the home key when the iPad is placed vertically in the stand, however, I am not experiencing that problem at all. I am not sure if the manufacturer adjusted the dimensions of the stand in response to this concern or if the new iPad simply has different dimensions, either way, it is not a problem with my stand. The stand is light weight and folds up perfectly flat, taking up minimal space in my school bag, which is perfect!Overall, you cannot beat the price and functionality of this stand.

When I received a piece of mail from Cox saying we could add external storage, I started researching drives to do this.

Surprisingly, everything worked as I expected it to. I plugged in the drive's power, then plugged in the esata cable. I received a message on the DVR saying it detected a new drive and asked me to format it. After confirming, within a few seconds it said the drive was ready. I went to the DVR list and noticed that I was now using a small percentage of my DVR space, so everything seemed to be working without any reboots of anything.

To put a specific device on the 5 mhz channel it was even more money because that was a new issue.Once I got everything hooked up I found the range was very disappointing and then after about an hour my speed went from 32 mbps down to 10 mbps. I rebooted and it was back to 32 and an hour later back to 10 and it did it again and again. To make sure it was not the cable I put the old 2.0 router back on which was not as fast along with a Medialink Wireless N router and it worked just fine with no sharp drop-off in speed. This unit is being sent back today.With that said I still think Motorola makes great products but if you want the fastest speeds out there you are going to have to get separate components.

I could not pass them up whatsoever. Total impulse buy, but I don't regret it! The actual pair I got was the last in stock at my local BB store. They were \"open item\" which imo means \"free extra discount\" because they were new and came with everything the factory sends with them, even little rubber feet you can stick on the bottom. They were in perfect, flawless condition. Got these for $40 when they list for so much more. Now, I never really have been interested in Polk because I feel they're too overpriced for what they are. I mean, this pair is $100 and I feel that's not worth it for what they are. Now I do have very high standards as I am an audiophile and audio engineer, but I do have a rather limited budget. So I really have mastered the price to performance ratio when I buy equipment. So I suppose for someone who doesn't have any quality speakers at all, these could be worth list price, just not to me. But this review isn't about price, so it's really up tp the individual buyer.Anyways, on to the speakers themselves... Immediately hooked them up to the HT when I got home. I'm using a Pioneer 521, 522? I don't remember off hand because I get confused as to what I have vs what the newest product is. It's Pioneer's standard AV receiver line which I think is the absolute best you could buy for the price. I would always go Pioneer for AV receivers, actually I would go HK first, but that's a whole different pricing niche. So I put on some Pink Floyd Dark Side cause I always use that CD for reference when working with audio since that album is sonically rich and detailed. I noticed, and even expected, the highs were a little flatter and more mellow than I am used to. This is probably because my stereo set up has JBL with titanium dome tweeters while these have silk soft dome. They even advertise this exact effect. And overall the sound sounded a little flat in all ranges. I personally did not like it and it turned me off from these speakers at first. But as I begin to listen and listen, I got used to the subtle change and really just judged these speakers as themselves, not comparing them to others. Which I think is a big mistake people do. They love to compare everything they buy to they're favorite set which is really unfair. They started to sound nice and clean. The highs presented themselves well but were not harsh, the mids cleared up a bit. Still a little muddy though. The bass was tight and accurate, but not deep (this is expected though and not a complaint). I started to tinker with an EQ and just some subtle touches will really bring these babies to life. So if you're using them for stereo mains, you might want to invest in a good EQ or tinker with your source if it has one. I think the speakers just need a good break in. I think that will add more definition to the sound and the flatness will slowly disappear. Definitely recommend a burn in period for these before any real listening.These have been permanently delegated to the job of surround speakers as I intended them to be. They are really good in this position. They have brought out so much more definition to the surround sound of HD TV and movies. I truly am immersed in the sounds of what I am watching now. These are the perfect surround speakers.So overall, they're good speakers. Might be worth list price for the first time buyer, but really try to get them on sale. Give em burn in time, and don't expect something these are not capable of doing. Use them as intended. They work best as surrounds, but can be good for small hifi applications at home or office. If you follow those things, you will be very happy with these speakers. Definitely recommended.*One really, really nagging thing though. Since it is Polk and they are pricy, I fully expected them to have crossovers. But I could find no information showing that they were. They really sound like they are, but I need concrete proof they are. I don't want to open up my brand new speakers just to check if they have xovers. So if anyone knows, please leave a comment with your proof. And a warning to any potential buyers, do some research and find out if they have xovers. Cause if not, they are worthless and definitely should not buy.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Superb as Surrounds, Decent as Mains/Fronts", "unixReviewTime": 1356134400, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2012"}

There seems to be an audible buzz in my speakers when the TV is off, but I'm not 100% sure that's the converter's fault.

Coudn't settle on one system as I still want to expand my research to as many samples until I get comfy with which one I want.  Then I happen to be at Sam's Club one day and I saw this Uniden Guardian G766.  Checked the reviews on amazon and found several happy customers and almost equally unhappy customers. What the heck, I'll just pick it up and pretend that the unhappy customers didn't exist.  Paid $349 plus tax.  Connectivity from camera to main unit is awesome. On one camera, its separated by 3 walls and 70-80 feet, no problems, image quality is great. The other camera is closer and just one wall separates.  After I hard-wire the main unit to the router using the included ethernet cable, it forever attempts to connect to the internet. This is where the word \"frustration\" is redefined at its best. It never connected to the internet except for a couple minutes when I power it down and power it back up which it connects to the internet for a couple of minutes and the connection drops and the error message will say \"connecting to the internet, please wait\". Yeah, I wait 2, 3 or 4 days and it never connected to the internet. I'm interested in being able to check these cameras on my iphone when I'm away from home since I work nights.  2 weeks later, I started to gather the packaging so I can re-package the unit and return it to Sam's Club. Image quality is great, everything else is a POS.  Took a nap, when I woke up, I saw the globe icon signifying \"connected to the internet\" (without the running dots).  Wallah!! Checked my PC and ran the OCX software on my Windows 7 starter netbook and yes!!! there's my surveillance camera, can now be seen on the internet.  Ran the iphone app and BINGO!!!  While I was on the freeway on my way to work, I can check the cameras via my iPhone on the go.  Great!! I immediately planned on writing a review on this unit regarding my \"natural high\" experience with how great this unit is.  As soon as got home from work in the morning, I turned the unit off to see if I can turn it back on with no problems.  Pressed the \"connect to the internet\" button and it's been trying to connect to the internet for more than 36 hours now.  Sam's Club here's your Uniden Guardian G766 and give me my money back.  And by the way, how come you don't see G766 model on the Uniden's website?  It only mentions G755.  If you can make this unit connect to the internet using the included ethernet cable, please share it.  Otherwise, this unit is a $350 piece of toy. Find something else. Unless you just want an in-house surveillance camera. Then this is good enough.Update 3/6/13:  I have found the trick (or the right way) to keep the main unit connected to the internet.  So, you can now see 4 stars on my review. I had it with 3 stars on my initial review based on being difficult to connect to the internet. Now that I'm able to see the cameras on my iPad and iPhone, I think this unit is PROBABLY one of the best in this price range. I say probably because I havent tried other units and I'm just basing my wild comparison on negative reviews of others in this price range.  Very good connection between unit and camera (80 feet with 3 walls in between, gives me 1 bar on the signal scale), picture quality is awesome even with 1 bar. I am now recommending this Uniden Guardian G755/G766 to anyone looking for a quality surveillance unit within this price range.  I can also view the cameras with my HP Netbook using Windows 7 starter. I have not yet enabled the video recording mode because there are a couple of palm tree leaves slightly in front of my Camera #1 and I dont want the system to record the video triggered by the constant moving of these leaves. However, I was able to snap a sample picture of my daughter as she was approaching the main door (from the outside) where my Cam #1 is mounted. I told her to stop for a moment so I can take a picture and check the image quality (this was taken at night, and my front door is lighted with a 75 watt incandescent bulb). Picture quality is better than I expected. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the add on cameras I think are a little expensive. I just purchased one camera yesterday directly from Uniden (amazon is out of stock) and it costs $129 plus tax and shipping, comes to $153. I paid $349 plus tax @ Sam's Club, main unit and 2 cameras for mine. The camera is well built, metal casing and feels heavy & strong but the price could be lower.Update 3/7/13:  I'm really frustrated now. While continuing to tweak my Uniden Guardian to connect to the internet, I was looking at the monitor when I saw the Fedex guy drop off a box. Yes, its my third camera which I paid $153. Wasnt excited since its useless for now. Cant connect to the internet.  Box still unopened as I write this update. An hour later, I went to Frys a mile away from my house to buy something for my home theater. Stopped by the security cameras section to see what they have. Well, I saw a heartbreaker: they have the Uniden Guardian G766 (same as mine) for $344 plus tax. No big deal, $5 cheaper from what I paid at Sam's Club. But when I looked at the box next to it, its the GC45 camera, same as the one I just got, price is $110!!! When I saw online that amazon was out of stock, I thought buying it straight from Uniden was the way to go. I have to find out and see if I can return this camera to Uniden, box still unopened.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good?  Maybe...Bad?

She thought her $20 GE radio was plenty adequate, even for an NPR junkie like herself.  Seeing that the Kloss Model One is the radio sold by NPR at its website store, I gave her one as a gift.  Now she claims that the prospect of waking up to its warm, rich sound is enough to make her look forward to getting up in the morning.  In fact, she's beginning to agitate for two more identical radios for additional rooms in the house.My own feelings about the radio are a bit more toned down but positive.  In most similar radios \"stereo\" is an exuse to use cheap speakers. This monaural unit, on the other hand, features one carefully tuned and balanced speaker (the weight of the magnet itself testifies to its superior quality), reminding some of us that the \"improvement\" of stereo over monaural \"hi fi\" can be illusory at best.  The sound is full, rich, and complete over the entire sonic spectrum.  Moreover, the absence of tone controls encourages the listener to trust the engineers' judgment rather than waste time on equalizer switches. (I'll confess that personally I miss the ability to increase the treble and roll back the bass, which is too strong even without the gratuitous add-on \"subwoofer.\")  Finally, the tuning knob is the smoothest and most accurate, not to mention the most finger friendly, that I've used.Pure functionality, elegant simplicity, and noticeable attention to quality (especially the wood cabinet) make this the one to own.  Add a CD player, and you have a mini-component system built around a sensitive, responsive tuner and carefully tuned speaker.  Add another speaker, and you've got a stereo system (a supplement that, according to Consumers' Reports, makes this a better-sounding radio than the Bose, Boston Acoustics, or Cambridge competitors)--but at the expense of some of the compactness and economy which is undeniably a big part of this item's understated appeal.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Oh, go splurge on spareness.", "unixReviewTime": 1113782400, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2005"}

Above water, the camera is everything expected (lightweight, stunning photos, easy navigation, slim profile, etc... If this was not advertised as a waterproof camera, I would have given it 4 stars... underwater is another story.  Before I get into what I happened, just know that I studied the user manual thoroughly before I used it in the water.The first day of the trip was completely away from the water.  Took some token pictures of mountains, the ocean, etc, etc; routine stuff.  The second day of my trip I went snorkeling and this is where the trouble began.  I took the camera snorkeling and captured some great pictures and video underwater.  Even in water the view finder provided clear images.  After about 30 minutes or so in the water, I swam back to the boat and began to clean the camera;  The manual provides basic cleaning instructions and I followed them to a tee.... about 45 minutes after I got onto the boat, I took the camera out to take some more pictures.  The camera came on, but all the buttons ceased to work.  I could not zoom in, use the menu or use any of the camera's functions after that.  I was relieved to find all my images/video were saved onto the SD card, but the camera was still inoperable, which is really a shame because the underwater shots came out great.Currently I am in the process of sending the camera back to Panasonic to see if they can do anything under the warranty... best case scenario they fix the camera and I use it only for above water photos... worst case scenario, I purchased a $135 paper weight...UPDATE 12/1/2012:I received a replacement camera late last week. In the notice included with the packaging, Panasonic stated the camera was either re-manufactured or brand new. From the looks of the packaging it appears to be a brand new camera.  Either way, the camera is in full working order and has been designated as my main \"out of water\" camera.  FYI... They also sent me an entire new set of cables, battery, charger, etc.. which was good because I left the original charger back in Mexico.About the process:I had to call and get a authorization code, send in the camera with a letter stating what happened and wait about 3-4 weeks.

I think this is a very worthy successor to the line. After a month of ownership, about 750 pictures and thousands of miles travelled with it, I can report that I am very pleased with it. My primary needs for this camera are something compact that I can throw in a carry on bag for travel or something that I can conveniently grab at home for a party or for Internet images. It must have excellent image quality, offer advanced features and controls and accept an external flash. The G11 meets all of these requirements and offers a few bonus features such as a built in ND filter, very good video (but non-HD which I don't care about) and a superb swivel display.I find camera operation very straightforward and I really appreciate the abundance of dials for ISO, Exposure Compensation, Modes and more. For me, it feels faster than software menus and is easily double checked visually. Power up is fast as is autofocus and I have rarely found myself waiting for the camera to catch up to me. This makes it well suited for travel or child photography where you must seize the moment. The lens range is excellent, particularly the wide end of 28 mm which again is very useful for travel where you may be shooting in tight interiors or trying to capture groups of people or large vistas. As with all lenses of this type, there is noticeable barrel distortion at the wide end which is correctable in post processing. Shooting small product images for auctions or sharing on the Internet is easy with the macro mode and the swiveling screen. The flash does a fair job of throttling down for close range. Macro shots might work better with a bounced external flash such as the 270EX though. Speaking of the 270EX, it makes a perfect mate for this camera because it is so small but still offers bounce capability. I am able to squeeze it into the Tamrac travel case that I use for the camera.The creative possibilities with the G11 are tremendous since output is really very good and the artistic control and features are so comprehensive. Kudos to Canon for the brave move of downsizing the megapixel count and focusing on image quality. The improvement in ISOs above 80 is very significant - I used it repeatedly at ISO 400 on a recent trip. With my old G9 I would not have considered using this setting because of the cost in image noise and quality. Battery life in my experience is very good and reliability overall for the camera looks promising since I used it in rain, sub-zero and hot temperatures without a hitch.If there are any drawbacks to the camera for me, they are that the controls are a little crowded for my average male hands and the multipurpose rotary dial on the back could use improvement, it is too cramped and spins too easily. The camera is otherwise so good that I don't mind working around this.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Sweet Travel or General Purpose Camera!", "unixReviewTime": 1262476800, "reviewTime": "01 3, 2010"}

The DWA-182 adapter is backward compatible with existing Wi-Fi devices and is ideal for upgrading your notebook or desktop with the latest generation of wireless performance.&#34; -- (*** emphasis mine)So the key part of this rant relates to this claim:  &#34;provides up to 300/867 Mbps performance&#34;If you break the 802.11 standards of these products down, you get the marketing terms you see on these newer AC networking products:AC750:  300mbps 802.11n + 433mbps 802.11ac ~= 750mbps thus &#34;750&#34;AC1200:  300mbps 802.11n + 867mbps 802.11ac ~= 1200mbpsetcThe problem with this product is that it uses the USB 2.0 interface, which *is limited to 480mbps* - almost half the 867mbps available through the 5GHz radio in this adapter.So if D-Link had simply labeled it an AC750 device (it effectively is), and had not given the completely false Product Description above (read it again), I'd have rated this higher and not complained at all - because I'd have been an informed customer and known what I was getting up front.  The adapter does peg out the USB port it is plugged into, and performs well - at ~480mbps.They cannot make the above claim in the Description, even if the radio within is capable of it, the system as manufactured is not.  Back it goes.  I hope this saves someone the hassle or getting cheated out of money.There are several other 802.11ac adapters out now that do have USB 3.0 interfaces (which would let you get closer to the full benefit of 802.11ac):- Edimax EW-7822UAC- ASUS USB-AC56- ZyXEL 11ac- Linksys WUSB6300- Rosewill AC1200UBEthough some of these have mediocre/crappy ratings.  I will update this review with a blurb about the Edimax when I receive it.Maybe D-Link will try to justify this in a reply (they seem to be watching these reviews).  To address anticipated response:&#34;But you can't really get 867mbps even with USB 3.0&#34;- no, but I can get closer to it than 480mbps.  That your product easily pegs out a USB 2.0 port (with nothing in its controller mate - they are usually ported in pairs on motherboards) shows that I can expect a USB 3.0 adapter to go well above this.  Change the marketing term used for this model to AC750, the Product Description to what's honest, and I'll have no complaint.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Not AC1200 performance, D-Link misleading on this one", "unixReviewTime": 1385078400, "reviewTime": "11 22, 2013"}

The sound is fantastic for the price, however, I also noticed that the position of the earbud in my ear determines the dampening of the bass.Here's my problem and why they get a 3 star review: I bought these because of the full metal quality and for me the braided sheathed earbud wires were the key selling point for me. After awhile, small part of the plastic wire came through the braiding (like a Hernia) and sure enough, only a week later, so much of the wire came through that it separated the entire braided sheath and is now completely exposed.I still use the earbuds because I'm the type who will use something until it's dead, but I am terribly disappointed with the Braided Sheath wearing and eventually exposing the wire.PROS:+ Love the Braided Sheath wires+ Appreciate the Full Metal construction+ Great color combination (I think this was intentional to match popular bike colors, great idea Skullcandy)CONS:- Braided sheath wears easily and quickly exposes the wire (please improve, I will buy these again)- Earbud suction causes bass to be minimized", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Love them and yet disappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1403395200, "reviewTime": "06 22, 2014"}

The image quality of this lens is quite amazing.  The kit lens is decent but the 60mm has a real punch to it.  It likes light... lots of it - and is a breeze to use.  In low light conditions I really have to watch the shutter speed. If hand held in AV mode the trick is to find the right balance between aperture and bumping up the ISO to achieve an acceptable shutter speed. One can always use a tripod but I get a bit lazy in that aspect. There is no IS with this lens so if I can keep the shutter speed at 1/100th of a second or faster handheld then I'm usually confident in avoiding any movement blurring.  Just depends on how steady you are. I've done some handhelds around 1/30 - 1/60 sec and lucked out too but the keeper rate is low for me.I use this lens the majority of times... street fairs, outdoor events, touristy/travel places, hiking and as a portrait lens.  It does challenge one to really think about composition as its equivalent to a 96mm lens on a crop sensor and my legs are the zoom factor.  I certainly can't overlook its macro abilities either.  The macro realm to me is quite demanding and many factors come into play but this lens can produce some amazing results.  I'm often floored, macro or not, viewing my pictures at 100%.  If you've nailed the focus you will see details that can be astounding!  Fire up your cropping tools in favorite photo editor and you'll find yourself getting several keepers out of 1 shot depending on what you want to emphasize.I find the USM focusing quite fast w/ very little hunting.  It seems really well built and its smaller form factor is a bonus when carrying around.  Less conspicuous and you don't feel like you've got a trumpet mounted on your camera body such as when my 18-200 is on full zoom.Bottom line - you will love this lens.  Dare I say it's almost \"L\" series in the quality of photos it takes?  This lens makes you work and pushes one to become a better photographer.  I don't feel the need to own a nifty or thrifty 50mm w/ this lens.

I did try it out in the store and I was immediately impressed with the results so I bought it on the spot.The disk is amazingly well packaged.  It's packaged just like an iPod that I received some years back.  It doesn't have the scrimpy, we-don't-care Made-In-China feel.  It comes with a lanyard, a semi-rigid pouch that you can attach to your belt, a CD with all of the PDF instructions in multiple languages and a how-to video.Their web-site also has instructions on how to set the Nikon D300 pre settings.For years, from the time I got my first DSLR I've been plagued by color balance issues.  It seems that I have to color correct each and every photograph in Photoshop.  I shoot in RAW so that I have more control but it takes so much more work and time.  I'm also not very good with color correctly with PS.  I have all the instructions and I follow them carefully, but I always had problems getting the hang of it.I own gray cards but they're bulky and I don't walk around with one.  I also haven't had very good luck with them either. I'm sure it's my technique but I never did get the hang of it.Shooting under artificial light is a real pain. Auto WB never really works.I first tried the ExpoDisk in a room lit with CFs (Compact Fluorescent) bulbs.  I used the ExpoDisk as directed and I received absolutely perfect results the first time.  Then I tried another room lit with LEDs.  Again, perfect results.  I put a Gretamacbeth colorchecker chart in each of my test shots.  Every time, the whites are whites and the blacks are black. Zero color cast.I've never been able to photograph granite and achieve the correct color. After using the ExpoDisk, the granite color perfectly matches the first time.  When photographing faces, I'm utterly clueless obtaining the correct tones unless I have a Gretamacbeth colorchecker chart in the photograph and fiddle around with Photoshop.  Again, ExpoDisk to the rescue.Maybe it's the camera or maybe it's me, but I also have problems with color casts using a flash with the color balance set to flash.  The ExpoDisk washed those problems away.Shooting under different lighting sources is a challenge.  Which do I aim at?  Unfortunately, the ExpoDisk never addresses that issue.  I probably have to use colored gels on the flash (I have the SB-900 and SB-800's) to neutralize the fluorescent bulbs.I don't intend to use this while casually walking around but when I want to be certain that the color balance is perfect, then I use the ExpoDisk.  Even at 77mm (the size of my largest lens so that it will fit all my other lenses) it's small enough to carry around in my pocket.  I don't know if I'm dorky enough to put it on my belt.The hardest time I had with this was getting the lanyard cord through the hole. The only way I could get that thick cord through the tiny hole was to take a sewing thread to make a loop and pull the lanyard cord through the hole.I've spent thousands of dollars on camera equipment but I've had so many problems getting the color balance correct and this relatively small investment has already saved me a lot of grief.  So perhaps I'm incompetent with Photoshop and gray cards, but this resolves so many of my problems to begin with.I can now shoot in RAW/JPG and directly use the JPGs when I don't need to adjust the exposure.

Onkyo had some production issues (strong demand) and so I waited MONTHS before one became available. On paper, the specs look very good.Ultimately, Onkyo bought-back my receiver from me because of several design flaws that firmware updates could not fix. For example, the DSPs are poorly designed such that there is a delay of 2-3 seconds when locking onto and audio stream. So every time I fast-forward through a commercial, the video plays for 2-3 seconds with no audio. Changing audio streams on Blu-Ray movies had the same delay.In addition, there is a significant audio delay that causes a mis-sync between audio and video. Again, Onkyo says a firmware update cannot fix the problem. I bypassed the Reon video processor to help with the problem, but then you lose the built-in scaling feature.Only service centers are permitted to do firmware updates. In my case, there was a 2-3 week backlog. Thankfully, one update leaked to the internet and I was able to do it myself. However, Onkyo found out about the leak and was not happy.Onkyo also makes no mention of any firmware updates on their web site.

And, once you get it working, it works.The minuses of this camera are that the installation process can be fidgity.  On my home computer, where I first installed it, I had trouble getting the network to recognize the camera.  I have a network hub leading from my main router, and it absolutely had to be plugged into the main router to work.  Once I got the hard wired network connection working, it took several attempts to get the wireless recognized.  I tried using the push button set up for the wireless.  Maybe it matters that I have a Linksys router, but the automated setup wouldn't work.  After I set the camera up at home and tested it I took it to my business.At my business I had more problems with the setup.  For some reason, with the network cable attached the camera kept grabbing the same IP address as the point of sale system.  I had to give the point of sale system a fixed IP and exclude it from the DHCP range.  Then I had to set up the camera and go into the desktop local web interface that is accessed from the camera's ip address.  Once I got there I gave the camera a fixed IP for the LAN.  I still had some trouble getting the wireless to work.  I tried using the push button set up.  Again, maybe because my router is a Linksys, it didn't work.  I was able to manually set up the wireless by using the web interface and typing in the password.Once I got it set up it seems to be working pretty well as a way to see into my business when I'm not there.  However, the sound barely works - it cuts in and out - mostly out.  This camera is really intended for uses like monitoring dogs during the day.  Since I know that all my dogs do is sleep I thought I'd try it at my business.  It would be nicer if the sound works.

Lomenzo \"Doc Tony\"", "helpful": [6, 7], "reviewText": "I'm rather heavy into the flight sim hobby for some years now and I wanted a larger monitor even tho' I have two 24\" monitors but I first looked at a 32\" monitor but the reviews when you step up to that size screen for use on a PC computer [versus as a TV or satellite monitor] is that the DPI on reading computer text especially on the internet can suffer when one uses the monitor 'other' than flight simming and switches to the internet so I settled on the 27\" and this monitor filled the bill perfectly and is not a wallet buster not to mention Prime free shipping.That all said, a few things to keep in mind. First and foremost, DO NOT let anyone tell you that when you get into larger monitors [24\" and over] that any dead pixels should be \"expected\" and on large monitors used for either TV, satellite TV or a PC [or 'whatever'] that \"one or more dead pixels are the nature of the beast\" -- this is complete nonsense! You should expect NO dead pixels whatsoever and if you see one, pack the monitor back up, go to Amazon returns and do the returns thing with the free UPS shipping label as a \"defective\" item and send it back for a replacement or a refund! You did not pay for 'any' dead pixels and this is one of the very first things you should check thoroughly when the monitor comes to life! What you should expect is a monitor free of any dead pixels or any other problems! Case closed! Hey, it's your money and your call but problems right out the box with 'any' new item should not be tolerated and doesn't have to be tolerated when a no hassle returns policy is in place and as is the case with Amazon who will make good on any defective items! And they have their 3rd party Amazon vendors follow suit!Now, notice that the monitor only ships with a DVI cable and a 15 pin VGA cable. Please note that a DVI cable and an HDMI cable [not provided] produce the exact same HDMI signal with the only difference being that an HDMI cable carries its own audio. There is NO difference in picture quality! You are also provided with a green coded PC audio cable but the speakers are not a strong point  of 'most' monitors that have them and you're looking at two 3 watt speakers to boot with a sound quality that is tinny at best! OK, OK, make that read \"stereo\" tinniness then and your best bet is to stick with your after-market speakers for decent sound  reproduction.Finally this, an HD monitor can spoil you! When you get it, go over to YouTube and check out some of the HD [but 1080p quality] clips. Very often I'll watch HD clips on 'real' airplanes, both take offs and landings and especially night landings and with 1080p HD, you'll swear you're right in the jump seat behind the pilot and first officer and the view can be quite spectacular. A little mechanical gear icon will come up in YouTube at the very bottom right of the screen to alert you that the clip is in HD although in some cases and even if your setting is in \"auto\", you can try to increase the HD level from 360p all the way up to the top to 1080p, if, of course, the original featured clip was filmed in that specification, 1080p.This too, this monitor will [or at least should] automatically fit your Windows screen. Some of the older HDMI screens came up too wide cutting out Windows icons but this can be easily remedied within the MONITOR buttons. Do NOT lower the resolution [in this monitor, 1920 X 1080] or you lose the benefit of the best picture! In older HDMI monitors, just make sure that the monitor setting is set to \"PC\" and NOT 'AV'! As I said tho', this Asus model will automatically fit your screen. Note to flight simmers! FSX will automatically detect the presence of an HDMI 1920 X 1080 monitor but for FS9 [2004] be sure to set the resolution for your new HDMI monitor using your OLD perhaps higher res monitor [the old favorite box shaped 1920 X 1200] and set FS9 to a lower HDMI resolution or the FS9 will give you what looks like a multi-strobe filled nightclub effect until you \"fix\" the new HDMI resolution especially if you are using dual [or more!] monitors which is very popular in flight simming. BTW, and again for flight sim enthusiasts, check out the successor to Helge Schroeder's fantastic FlightNav 4.7 which was great for FS98 through FS9 [2004] but will ==NOT== work in FSX but Helge's relatively new FSTramp [sic] nav program does work in FSX and works very well! As for those new Saitek external modules, and sold on Amazon, check out my reviews on them but don't forget to have two 'required' programs if you're thinking of buying any of those modules for your home sim set-up -- the Saitek module 25.7MB driver [or SPAD alternative driver] ==and== Pete Dowson's equally fantastic FSUIPC program. BOTH are required for the Saitek modules to work correctly.

As a commuter, I wanted something portable that would offer some isolation.I tested the Bose QC20i and the M-100s on a flight from the US to India so I had adequate time with each. The Bose noise canceling is as good as advertised but I didn't like the battery pack or the pressure sensation in my ears. Both were worse than expected.I decided that the volume and punch of the M-100 suited me more despite some concerns. It wasn't until I tried the Momentums during a layover in Frankfurt that I began to question my decision.Even though the M-100 seemed powerful and well built, I was frustrated by the negative effect that the bass had on the vocals, particularly for Rock tracks (i.e., Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters). Worse still, the metal arms scratched the very first time I zipped them into the case. The case is so compact that the elastic straps meant to hold the cables actually position the metal ends in contact with the arms. I rated the M-100 at 4 stars just the same because V Moda was willing to replace them as a result if the scratching issue.I decided to test the Momentums and was struck by a few things. The leather ear pads feel better than the pleather on the M-100s and the ear pieces rotate allowing for a more precise, comfortable fit. They were also much lighter to wear. Those factors, combined with crisp, detailed audio pushed me over the top and I simply returned the M-100s.I'm not &#34;headphone guy&#34; who will have $1000 - $2000 invested in multiple headphones and decided that in this price range, the Momentum offered the best comfort and quality. I am a bit concerned by the flimsy feel of the cable over the long-term but preferred every other aspect.The only reason that this set didn't earn 5 stars is the cost of replacement cables for long-term use.

Dowdie", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "On the whole, I am pleasantly surprised that this inexpensive little switch works as well as it does.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the switch will recognize Num Lock key-presses as well as Scroll Lock.  (Scroll Lock can be problematic due to the horrible F Lock key arrangement on Microsoft keyboards.)I am using it with a Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse set, which has one USB connector and one PS2 connector (disconnected).  It seems fully compatible with the mouse and keyboard.  All the special keys and mouse buttons work just as when directly connected.I am only using the keyboard and mouse portion of the switch since both computers have their own monitors, so I can't speak to display quality or performance.The only major problem I've found is the one others have reported with VMware.  When moving the mouse in and out of a VMware window where a VM is running, it can cause the switch to jump to the other computer.  Worse, if VMware is set for the VM to capture new USB devices when in focus (I believe this is the default), it will try to connect to the KVM directly when you switch it back to the first computer.  So, there is no way to regain keyboard and mouse control on the first computer without removing the switch and directly connecting the keyboard/mouse.  I don't think this is a problem so much with this switch as with VMware itself, which apparently generates multiple Scroll Lock and/or Num Lock key-presses when switching focus to/from the VMs; so I'm guessing any KVM switch that uses these keystrokes would be affected.You should also know that switching between computers effectively disconnects the USB keyboard and mouse device(s) from the first computer and connects them to the second one.  This generates a cacophony of Windows kerplonk USB connect and disconnect sounds along with causing a couple of seconds of delay before the keyboard and mouse are connected to the new computer.  Not a big problem, but something to keep in mind.  Given the way this works, a simple mechanical USB A/B switch might work just as well or better for my needs.My only other minor gripe is that I have to press Num Lock (or Scroll Lock) twice more slowly than is natural (about 1/2 second between presses).  Any quicker and the switch does not seem recognize the keystrokes and doesn't switch between PCs.The little instruction booklet that comes with the switch is put together in an interesting way.  It seems to flow from back to front with no real rhyme or reason as to how the different languages are ordered.  Whole pages of Russian, French, etc. are interspersed seemingly at random with English pages.  I don't mind having the other languages in there, but the random layout must be a printing mistake which doesn't speak well to quality control.None of these issues would prevent my from keeping this switch, except for VMware which I use frequently.  I've not yet found an acceptable workaround for this, so I'm going to try the simpler IOGear switch that has a wired remote button and may not be sensitive to these keystrokes.  The reviews of that switch have me questioning whether it will work with the wireless mouse and keyboard, but I'm going to give it a try.Update:  I received the IOGear GCS22U switch with the wired remoteIOGear 2-Port USB KVM Switch with Cables and Remote GCS22U (Black).  It works just as well as this Trendnet for my needs, but avoids the issue with VMware altogether since it does not listen for Num Lock or Scroll Lock.  I actually prefer the IOGear's small wired remote in any case.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Works well, except with VMware", "unixReviewTime": 1260230400, "reviewTime": "12 8, 2009"}

{"reviewerID": "A1YLE4WIPHNZGT", "asin": "B003BIFOL8", "reviewerName": "JTS", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "I purchased this receiver in June 2010 and so have had time to digest all the options and features of this product so that I can provide a fair review.  I use this receiver primarily for home theater and its been excellent so I rate the product 5 stars.  I havent run into the video issues that have been mentioned in prior posts.  Currently, my receiver powers two Polk RTi10 floor standing speakers, a HSU subwoofer, a Polk CSi A6 center channnel speaker and two Polk bookshelf rear speakers.  Its connected to my Panasonic 50\" LCD projection TV via HDMI and the main input is a Sony BDP 570 blu ray player connected via HDMI.  It took me about 6 months to really tweak the setting to my liking but thats one of the great features about this reciever is that there are numerous options to change the sound to your preference.  The first and most obvious thing to do once your ready is to run the Audyssey 2EQ Speaker Setup function and then you can tweak from there, if needed.A few things to note that I gathered from trial and error and from trolling all the AVS forums about this receiver.  When I first started playing blu ray movies I noticed the dialogue tended to be very weak and the explosions and sound effects were very loud.  All the speakers were connected properly and it wasnt the blu ray player because I tried a different brand player and got the same results.  To solve this problem, I found that setting the Onkyo Dynamic Volume option from OFF to LIGHT makes a huge difference in sound.  It will do a light compression on the sound, which some audio purist may be opposed to but it makes the dialogue so much better and louder and based on what I hear, it doesnt degrade the overall sound at all.  Just make sure you have a decent center channel speaker to handle it, otherwise you might have to decrease the center speaker setting down a couple of db's.  The other thing I noticed is that this reciever has a Late Night setting which lowers the overall volume for evening viewing if you don't want to wake your neighbors.  This setting is defaulted to Auto.  However, when playing certain movies it will trigger the Late Night feature and the volume is very muted.  This happened to me when I played Star Trek and I realized that I need to switch the Late Night setting from Auto to OFF.  This makes a big difference in sound.  The feature only applies for discs with Dolby True HD sound.  The final observation I made was that the volume level will typically be at a 50% setting for decent sound.  I initially thought this was too high because my old Technics reciever would get really loud when I had the volume turned up to 25%.  I found out later that 50% is about right and its not an issue of weakness in the reciever because this reciever is plenty powerful.As a final note, I purchased this product on Amazon and received it no problem with free shipping and no taxes so rest assured that Amazon's delivery is just as reliable for electronics as it is for books.  When I ordered this it was based on reading countless reviews here and on CNET and other audio video websites and forums.  I never went to any store to physically test out the product so it was a leap of faith on my part that I was ordering based soley on what I read and Onkyo's reputation for putting out quality audio equipment.  So far I have not been disappointed in my decision.UPDATE July 2013: I decided to recently retire this receiver and upgrade to a Marantz receiver.  In hindsight, looking back on my experience with this product I would say that it wasn't great.  I'm saying this because after hearing the sound produced from the Marantz when compared to the Onkyo I find that the Marantz produces a more balanced and warmer sound whereas the Onkyo sounds a little more harsh when the volume is turned up.  Also, for some reason whenever I start up a movie with the Onkyo it seems like the sound is a tad muted so I would go into the receiver menu options and switch the dynamic volume from Light to Off and back to Light and that would bring the sound back to normal levels.  I had to do this everytime I watched a movie and it would only work for movies encoded in DTS-MA.  Additionally, I had some HDMI issues where I would suddenly lose video and audio in the middle of a 3D movie.  I had to tinker with the connections for a few hours by trying other receiver inputs which seemed to work but I would run into instances where the video would show but the audio would cut in and out.  Eventually everything started working again and I couldn't tell if it was because of my tinkering or it just fixed itself.  So that experience left me a little uneasy.  One note - if you are watching high definition in Blu Ray with this receiver then one of the biggest adjustments you need to do is to turn off the video processing function.  The details on how to do that can be found in the other reviews here.  I can tell you it makes a huge difference in video quality especially if you are sending a 1080p 24fps video signal from the player and the tv is 1080p compatible.  The video processer really dulls down the picture but if you turn it off the picture is a lot sharper and pops from the screen.  At the end of the day I felt that the combination of all the tweaking and adjustments that you need to make to get around all the different issues encountered with this receiver did not warrant a 5 star rating product and therefore I downgraded the rating accordingly even though this is a discontinued product.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Some home theater tips for this receiver", "unixReviewTime": 1295222400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2011"}

I cant believe it, I put 4 of them in a ported box in my 2002 Yukon i have them wired at 4 ohm with a Planet Audio 4000 watt amp the subs are only getting 1500 watts. Each sub says there 1000 watts that is peak, i'm guessing 300 RMS per sub but I've had them for 2 weeks there still breaking in they don't have a lot of flex yet. i have no complaints the sub is actually 10.5\" across not 10\" just fyi there very heavy subwooofers. They say 70oz magnet and there is 2 of them but idk why there are 2 70oz magnets lol. If you have any questions just ask on my review i did post a video of them on youtube it wont let me paste the link to amazon for some reason. for $30 you cant go wrong i promise i know what people say but just from my experience i would highly recommend these subs for any one. I've had re sex, db k5 okur, db speed, db platinum, kicker L7, kicker comp, and punch p3, ive had stereo systems that cost me $2000 and $3000 and this one is amazing for the price.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a freaking mazing subwoofers", "unixReviewTime": 1373241600, "reviewTime": "07 8, 2013"}

Listening to music outside on my patio without having to run inside to change volume etc is a joy, and the sound is as good as my Bose exterior speakers. The ability to mount multiple generations of iPods is a huge plus. When my color iPod was stolen, I dusted off my old 3G iPod, and it works seamlessly with the Hi-Fi. The remote changes songs and does everything I need. If you have an current generation video iPod, it can even change the EQ to what you prefer when listening to the speakers as opposed to with ear speakers. (I've tested this feature with my wife's iPod, and it is really cool.)  I just wish that Apple had made a way to attach the remote to the unit for transport.

Me and my wife were always trying to get each others calendar dates synced so we would email each other our schedules and put them in manually on our devices and computer so we can all be on the same page but at changed when i got mobile me.Now she can put her schedule in on our phone and ill get it on mine along with my iPad, or computer and on the mobile me site. Any time I have to put a new contact or edit a contact she gets the same information across the board. And that's just a fraction of what mobile me is.I love Gallery, when i need to free up space on my phone, i send my photos and videos to the MobileMe gallery which happens to be paired up with my IPhoto so whatever i upload is in my iPhoto without me having to connect my phone to import my photos. iDisk is just as amazing, though i wish there was more flexibility within the iPhone app i still think it's an over all amazing product.I recommend this to anyone who wants to sync multiple devices without having to manually do it on each one.

It was actually really simple, but we did have to run to CVS for an HDMI cable (they only include a standard RCA video cable). One oddity: it could be their older TV, but I couldn't get the audio to transfer over HDMI. The Roku allows plugging in both the RCA and the HDMI cables at the same time though, and that worked fine.Since I also bought anApple TVfor my mom, I could compare the two devices from unboxing and setup, to use. Roku wins hands-down on most points, much to my surprise. I'm addicted to Apple products, and figured that spending a little extra on my mom was the smart move. In the end, I wish I'd have gotten her the Roku. Roku feels more like an Apple product than the Apple TV - it has apps, an app store (with fun games even!), and an easy-to-use interface. Apple's interface by contrast is pretty, but more complicated in structure.We were impressed by the video quality of both the streaming videos and the games. Angry birds with the Roku remote is shockingly fun to play as a group. Speaking of which, the remote is probably the best remote I've ever used - much better than the wii's remotes.The whole family loves it, and I'd recommend it highly. In fact, we'll probably grab ourselves the Roku at some point.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Pleasantly surprised by this little monster!", "unixReviewTime": 1324944000, "reviewTime": "12 27, 2011"}
